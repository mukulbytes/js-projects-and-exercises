## Project Overview

This project is a basic Todo List that allows users to add tasks. The tasks are stored in an array, and the user can add new tasks by inputting text and clicking the "Add" button.

## Project Functionality

- **Add Todo**: Users can input a task into the input field and add it to the todo list by clicking the "Add" button. The task is then pushed into the `todoList` array.

## What I Learned

- How to capture user input using JavaScript.
- Basic DOM manipulation with `document.querySelector`.
- Using arrays to store and manage dynamic data.
- Clearing input fields after processing user input.

## Methods Used

- **JavaScript Arrays**: The `todoList` array is used to store the tasks.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Captured user input from the text field using `document.querySelector`.
- **Console Logging**: Used `console.log` to view the array of tasks in the console.

## Code Overview

- The `addTodo()` function is triggered when the "Add" button is clicked. It captures the value from the input field and adds it to the `todoList` array. The input field is cleared after the task is added.
