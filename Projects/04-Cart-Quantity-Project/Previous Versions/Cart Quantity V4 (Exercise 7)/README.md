# Cart Quantity Project Version 4

## Project Overview

In Version 4 of the Cart Quantity Project, the logic for adding and removing items has been streamlined. This version consolidates the functionality into a single function for updating the cart quantity, whether adding or removing items. The cart maintains a maximum limit of 10 items and a minimum of 0 items.

## Project Functionality

- **Show Quantity**: Displays the current quantity in the cart.
- **Add to Cart**: Allows adding items to the cart in quantities of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, with a maximum limit of 10 items.
- **Remove from Cart**: Allows removing items from the cart in quantities of 1, 2, or 3, with a minimum limit of 0 items.
- **Reset Cart**: Resets the cart quantity to 0.

## What I Learned

- Streamlined the code by consolidating add and remove functionalities into a single function.
- Enhanced code maintainability and reduced redundancy by handling all cart operations through `updateCartQuantity`.

## Methods Used

- Consolidation of code to handle various operations within a single function.
- Conditional logic to enforce cart limits and prevent invalid operations.
- Alerts and console logs for user feedback and debugging.

## Code Overview

- The `updateCartQuantity` function adjusts the cart quantity based on the input and ensures that the cart stays within its limits.
- The `showqty` function logs the current cart quantity to the console.
- The `resetcart` function resets the cart to 0 and provides an alert.
