# Cart Quantity Project - Version 1

## Project Overview
Version 1 of the Cart Quantity Project builds upon Version 0 by introducing a JavaScript file for better code organization. This version includes buttons to show, add to, and reset the cart quantity, with a focus on using external JavaScript functions.

## Project Functionality
- **Show Quantity**: Displays the current cart quantity in the console.
- **Add To Cart**: Increases the cart quantity by 1.
- **+2**: Increases the cart quantity by 2.
- **+3**: Increases the cart quantity by 3.
- **Reset Cart**: Resets the cart quantity to 0.

## What I Learned
- Improved code organization by separating JavaScript from HTML.
- Enhanced understanding of JavaScript function usage and event handling.

## Methods Used
- External JavaScript file (`script.js`) for managing cart operations.
- Functions to handle cart quantity changes and display updates.

## Code Overview
- **HTML**: Provides buttons for each cart operation and links to an external JavaScript file.
- **JavaScript**: Contains functions to manage the cart quantity and handle user interactions, including `showqty`, `addtocart`, `addtwo`, `addthree`, and `resetcart`.
