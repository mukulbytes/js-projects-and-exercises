# JavaScript Basics - Lesson 1 Exercises

This repository showcases my solutions to Lesson 1 of the JavaScript Basics. These exercises helped me get comfortable with fundamental concepts such as alerts, basic math operations, and manipulating the DOM with `document.body.innerHTML`.

## Exercise Questions

### Note: do these exercises in the Console (right-click > Inspect > Console)

### 1a. Use `alert(...);` to display "Good morning!" in a popup.

### 1b. Display your name in a popup.

### 1c. Using math, calculate 10 + 5 in the Console.

### 1d. Calculate 20 - 5 in the Console.

### 1e. Calculate 2 + 2 - 5 in the Console.

### 1f. Use `document.body.innerHTML =` to display "Good morning!" on the web page.

### 1g. Display your name on the web page.

## Challenge Exercises

### 1h. You order a T-shirt for $10, socks for $8, and dinner plates for $20. Use JavaScript to calculate the total cost of your order.

### 1i. Your bank account has $100, you spend $20 on lunch, $50 on dinner, and earn $200 from your job. Calculate how much money you have.
