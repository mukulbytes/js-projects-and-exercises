# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Together - Lesson 10 Exercises

This repository showcases my solutions to **Lesson 10** of the JavaScript Basics course. These exercises focus on integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive buttons, manage button states, and style web projects.

## Exercise Questions

### Create the following buttons using HTML and CSS. The styles don't have to be exact (just use your best judgment).

### 10a. Amazon Button

### rgb(255,216,20)

### 10b. Uber Buttons

### rgb(230,230,230)

### 10c. classList has another method, classList.contains('class-name'), which checks if an element has a class.

- Create a button: `<button class="js-button">Test</button>`
- Use `document.querySelector()` and `classList.contains('js-button')` to check if this button has the class 'js-button'.
- `console.log()` the result.

### 10d. Create the button below. When clicking this button, it should turn ON/OFF.

Hints:

- When clicking the button, add or remove the class 'is-toggled', and use it to change the styling.
- Use if (classList.contains('is-toggled')) to decide whether to add or remove the 'is-toggled' class.

### 10e. Continuing from 10d, create 3 buttons that can be turned ON/OFF.

### 10f. Continuing from 10e, use a function to reuse the code, and separate each language into its own file (if you didn't do this already).

### Challenge Exercises

### 10g. Modify 10f so that only 1 button can be ON at a time.

### 10h. Create a file `10h.html` and [copy the code from](https://github.com/SuperSimpleDev/javascript-course/blob/main/2-copy-of-code/10-dom-projects.html) `10-dom-projects.html`. In the Amazon Shipping Calculator, if we type a number less than 0, display a red error message below the text box.

### 10i. We'll style the calculator project using CSS.

- Make a [copy of exercise 9j](https://github.com/SuperSimpleDev/javascript-course/blob/main/1-exercise-solutions/lesson-09/9j.html).
- In your browser, go to: [supersimple.dev/projects/calculator-final](https://supersimple.dev/projects/calculator-final). This is the final design for the project.
- Using CSS, style the calculator project to look like the final design on the right.

### 10j. Continuing from exercise 10i, separate each language into its own file (if you didn't do this already).
