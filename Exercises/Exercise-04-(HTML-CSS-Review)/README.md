# HTML CSS Review, console.log - Lesson 4 Exercises

This repository showcases my solutions to **Lesson 4** of the JavaScript Basics. These exercises focus on reviewing HTML and CSS basics, and using `console.log` for debugging and messaging. The exercises include creating and styling HTML elements and integrating JavaScript for dynamic behavior.

## Exercise Questions

### Note: to do these exercises, create an HTML file (like 4a.html, 4b.html, ..)

### 4a. Create a button with the text 'Click' inside.

### 4b. Create 2 buttons. 1 with your name and 1 with your favorite food.

### 4f. Add the HTML structure to exercise 4e (add `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` and put the elements into the `<head>` or `<body>`). (For more practice, add the HTML structure to exercises 4a-4d).

### 4g. Continuing from 4f, change the title at the top of the tab to 'Buttons'.

### 4h. Continuing from 4g, add a `<script>` element so that when the page loads, it displays the message 'Welcome!' in the Console.

## Challenge Exercises

### Setup: create a new file 4i.html for exercises 4i and 4j.

### 4i. Using HTML and CSS, try to copy the design below. (Make sure to follow the HTML structure.)

### 4j. Continuing from 4i, add `onclick="..."` attributes to the two buttons:

- When clicking 'Add to cart', create a popup with the text 'Added'.
- When clicking 'Buy now', display the message 'Loading...' in the Console, and then create a popup with the text 'Purchased'.
