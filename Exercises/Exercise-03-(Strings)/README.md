# Strings - Lesson 3 Exercises

This repository showcases my solutions to **Lesson 3** of the JavaScript Basics. These exercises focus on working with strings, including concatenation, template literals, and multi-line strings. I also explored how to handle numbers in strings and display text using popups.

## Exercise Questions

### Note: do these exercises in the Console (right-click > Inspect > Console)

### 3a. Create the text `'My name is: '` as a string.

### 3b. Create your name as a string (for example: 'Simon').

### 3c. Using concatenation, add the 2 strings from 3a and 3b together to create the text: '`My name is: (replace with your name)`'.

### 3d. At a restaurant, you order 1 coffee (&dollar;5) and 1 bagel (&dollar;3). Using math, calculate the total cost, and using concatenation, create the text: `'Total cost: $'` (replace with the total you calculated).

### 3e. Do the same thing as 3d, but use a template string and interpolation.

### 3f. Display the text from 3e in a popup using `alert(...)`.

### 3g. You order 1 coffee (&dollar;5.99) and 1 bagel (&dollar;2.95). Using math, calculate the total cost, and using concatenation, create the text: `'Total cost: $'` (hint: calculate in cents to avoid inaccuracies).

### 3h. Do the same thing as 3g, but use a template string and interpolation.

### 3i. Display the text from 3h in a popup.

### 3j. Using a multi-line string, create the text from 3h and add a line of text underneath: `'Thank you, come again!'`. Display both lines in a popup.

## Challenge Exercises

### Setup: In the [Amazon project](https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/), update the cart to 2 basketballs (&dollar;20.95 each) with &dollar;4.99 shipping, and 2 t-shirts (&dollar;7.99 each) with &dollar;4.99 shipping.

![Challenge Exercise](https://i.imgur.com/O7ltn0z.png)

### 3k. Using interpolation, create the first line of text (use math to calculate the numbers 4 and 57.88).

### 3l. Create the second line of text: `'Shipping & handling: $9.98'` (use math).

### 3m. Create the third line: `'Total before tax: $67.86'` (use math).

### 3n. Create the fourth line of text: 'Estimated tax (10%): &dollar;6.79' (use math and `Math.round(...)` to calculate the exact number).

### Finish: Change the cart back to 1 basketball, 1 t-shirt (both free shipping).
