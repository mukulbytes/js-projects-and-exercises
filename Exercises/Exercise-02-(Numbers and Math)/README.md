# Numbers & Maths - Lesson 2 Exercises

This repository showcases my solutions to **Lesson 2** of the JavaScript Basics. These exercises focus on working with numbers, performing arithmetic operations, and calculating taxes, all within JavaScript. I also explored how to avoid rounding errors and how to round numbers both up and down.

## Exercise Questions

### Note: do these exercises in the Console (right-click > Inspect > Console)

### 2a. At a restaurant, you order 1 soup for $10, 3 burgers for $8 each, and 1 ice cream for $5. Use JavaScript to calculate the cost of the order.

### 2b. You're at a restaurant with 2 friends (3 people in total) and make the same order as 2a. Calculate how much each person pays.

### 2c. Calculate the total cost of a toaster ($18.50) and 2 shirts ($7.50 each).

### 2d. Calculate a 10% tax for the total in exercise 2c.

### 2e. Calculate a 20% tax for the total in 2c (remember that 1% = 1 / 100, so 20% = 20 / 100 = 0.2).

### Setup: In the [Amazon project](https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/), go to the home page and add a toaster ($18.99) to your cart so you have 1 basketball, 1 t-shirt, and 1 toaster. Choose $4.99 shipping for the toaster.

### 2f. Calculate the cost of the products (before shipping and taxes). Hint: calculate in cents to avoid inaccuracies.

### 2g. Calculate the Total before tax.

### 2h. Calculate the 10% tax exactly. Hint: use `Math.round()`

### 2i. Calculate Order total at the bottom. Finish: after finishing 2i remove the toaster from your cart.

### 2j. Let's say we want to always round a number down (2.8 => 2). Using Google or an A.I. tool, search for the code to do this.

### 2k. Let's always round a number up (2.2 => 3). Search how to do this.

## Challenge Exercises

### We'll use JavaScript to convert temperatures from Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F). The formula is:

- `Fahrenheit = (Celsius \* 9/5) + 32`
- `Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) \* 5/9`

### 2l. The temperature is 25°C. Calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit. (77)

### 2m. The temperature is 86°F. Calculate the temperature in Celsius. (30)

### 2n. The temperature is -5°C. Calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit. (23)

## My Solution

In this exercise, I worked on applying basic arithmetic and rounding techniques in JavaScript. I learned how to avoid rounding errors when dealing with currencies and how to calculate taxes accurately in e-commerce scenarios. These concepts are foundational for any project that involves transactions.
